// MultiLineDiff - A library for creating and applying diffs to multi-line text
// Supports Unicode/UTF-8 strings and handles multi-line content properly

/// Represents a single diff operation with three core transformation types
/// 
/// DiffOperation is the fundamental building block for describing text transformations.
/// It supports three primary operations: retain, insert, and delete.
///
/// - `retain`: Keeps existing characters from the source text
/// - `insert`: Adds new content not present in the source
/// - `delete`: Removes characters from the source text
///
/// # Performance Characteristics
/// - Constant-time operation creation O(1)
/// - Memory-efficient value type
/// - Supports Unicode and multi-line text
///
/// # Example
/// ```swift
/// let diff: [DiffOperation] = [
///     .retain(5),        // Keep first 5 characters
///     .delete(3),        // Remove next 3 characters
///     .insert("Swift")   // Insert "Swift"
/// ]
/// ```

    ///
    /// This method provides a flexible and powerful way to generate diff operations
    /// that transform one text into another. It supports two primary algorithms:
    /// Brus (fast, O(n)) and Todd (semantic, O(n log n)).
    ///
    /// # Algorithms
    /// - `.zoom`: Optimized for simple, character-level changes
    ///   - Fastest performance
    ///   - Best for minimal text modifications
    ///   - O(n) time complexity
    ///
    /// - `.megatron`: Semantic diff with deeper analysis
    ///   - More intelligent change detection
    ///   - Preserves structural context
    ///   - O(n log n) time complexity
    ///
    /// # Features
    /// - Unicode/UTF-8 support
    /// - Metadata generation with source verification
    /// - Flexible line number tracking
    /// - Automatic truncated source detection
    ///
    /// # Example
    /// ```swift
    /// let source = "Hello, world!"
    /// let destination = "Hello, Swift!"
